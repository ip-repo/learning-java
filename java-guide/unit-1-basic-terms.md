# Unit 1:  Basic Terms in Computer Science


A system is composed of two parts that work together:
- **Hardware**
- **Software**

There is a dependency that exists between hardware and software.
On one hand, the software defines or instructs the hardware on what to do, and on the other hand, the hardware sets the ground rules for the software. The hardware defines the kind of instructions that the software can execute.

**Example**: Using car components (wheels, pedals), we can instruct the car where and how to go. But then again, the engine, the car type, and the components define how we can use the car (a simple car is not like a jeep).

Sure thing! Here are some emojis that could fit well with the text:

### Hardware

The physical components of the system.
- **Internal components**: CPU, memory, motherboard... 🖥️
- **Peripheral (external) components**: Keyboard, mouse, printer... ⌨️🖱️🖨️

#### Important Hardware Components

- **I/O (Input/Output)**: Allows the user to interact with the computer (like a mouse or a digital drawing board). 🎛️
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The component that runs the program's commands one after the other. 💽
- **Memory**: 
    - Main Memory 🧠
    - Secondary Memory 💾

#### Main Memory

This is the type of memory that the CPU can access directly. It is used to process and run data.
- This memory is built from cells that store values. 📦
- If we have large data to store, it will be stored in sequence in the cells. 🔗
- In many systems, every cell size is **1 byte** (8 bits). 🧩
- The size of this memory is defined as the number of bytes it can store. 📊
- A typical main memory size can range between 1 to 16 GB. 📈

#### Secondary Memory

- Its purpose is to store programs and data before and after processing. 📂
- It is also used to transfer data from system to system and for backups. 🚚🔄
- A typical secondary memory size can range from 128 GB to 3 TB. 💽📦

#### Key Differences Between Main and Secondary Memory

1. Main memory is connected directly to the CPU, while secondary memory is not. 🔌
2. Main memory is volatile (without power, the data will be erased), whereas secondary memory is non-volatile (without power, the data remains saved). 🔋💾
3. Main memory is connected directly to the motherboard, while secondary memory is connected via a cable. 🖥️🔌
4. Main memory has direct CPU access, while secondary memory does not. 🧠💾
5. Accessing main memory is relatively fast, while accessing secondary memory is relatively slow. ⚡🐢
6. The main goal of main memory is to process data, while the goal of secondary memory is to store data. 🧠📦
7. Main memory is relatively small in size, whereas secondary memory is larger. 📏📐

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU consists of three central units:
- **CU (Control Unit)**: Coordinates data transfer and instructions between main memory and registers. It also coordinates the ALU's actions on the data saved in registers. 🔄
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: 📐➕➖
- **Registers**: Memory units 📊

### Software

Software consists of instructions and data that define how the computer will act or what it will do and when. 📜💻

There are two main kinds of software:
- **OS Program**: Software related to the operating system. The operating system is an interface that allows the user to interact with the system. It also manages system resources. 🖥️🔧
- **Applications**: A generic name for programs that are not part of the operating system. For example, word processors, games, browsers. 📱🕹️🌐
